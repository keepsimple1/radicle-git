//! # `git-storage`
//!
//! This crate provides access to git [references][refs] and [objects][objs].
//!
//! To first initialise the storage use [`Write::open`].
//!
//! After the storage is initialised, use [`Write::open`] or [`Read::open`] for
//! read-write or read-only access to the underlying storage. These structs will
//! implement the traits below depending on their access levels.
//!
//! ## Read-only access
//!
//! * [`refdb::Read`]
//! * [`odb::Read`]
//!
//! ## Read-write access
//!
//! * [`refdb::Read`]
//! * [`refdb::Write`]
//! * [`odb::Read`]
//! * [`odb::Write`]
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//!
//! [`Read`] and [`Write`] can be sent between threads, but it can't be shared
//! between threads. _Some_ operations are safe to perform concurrently in much
//! the same way two `git` processes can access the same repository.
//! However, if you need multiple [`Read`]/[`Write`]s to be shared between
//! threads, use a [`Pool`] instead.
//!
